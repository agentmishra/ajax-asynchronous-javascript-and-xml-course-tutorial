About the Course/Tutorial
---------------------
Hi All, I'm **`Dinanath Jayaswal, Senior UI/Web Developer and Adobe Certified Expert Professional`**, I wanna welcome you to `AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) Crash Course for Beginners`. This course/tutorial will give you a complete understanding of how to work with AJAX methodology/concepts to fetch/exchange (send and receive data) to-from web server.

This course will cover the basics of understanding JSON and AJAX using the practical implementation in your web development project. In this tutorial will explore how AJAX works and how it is used in web applications, will also see what `Fetch` and `XHR` are and how they work to get data.


Who is this for? 
---------------------
This course is for anyone interested in quickly learning AJAX+JSON & it's power to utilize it in Web Development. 

This Course/Tutorial is ideal for:
- Anyone who wants to learn AJAX from scratch
- Programmers and Developers at any level
- Web developers / Web Designers / Application developers / Software Developers
- Mobile Developers using the HTML5 Stack
- Anyone who wants to interchange data exchange between clients and servers
- Anyone who wants to create Dynamic Applications and use data seamlessly within web applications

This course/Tutorial is for anyone and everyone, Almost everyone!

Why learn AJAX
---------------------
`AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML`. JSON and AJAX together provide web developers with incredible opportunities to `integrate external data seamlessly (without page refresh/reload)` into web applications. AJAX helps to create and develop an amazing `interactive dynamic applications with better user experiences` that can synchronize data between your database and your front end HTML code (`minimizes the load on your server` and makes your `applications respond quickly and without reloading the HTML` page).

 1 Introduction to AJAX
=====================

1.1. What is AJAX?
--------------------- 

- `AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)`
- `AJAJ (Asynchronous JavaScript and JSON)`

The process of **`sending and receiving data on the fly without page refresh/reload`** is known as AJAX

- AJAX is not a new programming language - actually its a methodology or concepts or special way to bring JavaScript and XML (JSON) together to produce impressive results
- AJAX is set of web technologies - just uses a combination of:
  - A browser built-in `XMLHttpRequest object` to request data froma web server
  - `JavaScript and HTML DOM` to display or use the data
- AJAX allows the web page to `"talk/communicate"` with the server behind the scene (send and receive data asynchronously)
- AJAX sends, receives and process information to or from the server without page refresh/reload (does not interfere with current web page/data) 
- AJAX minimize the page refreshes, so web sites/pages/web apps shows more fluid/elegent-better experience to users
- AJAX and JSON together provides the ability to JavaScript code to make HTTP requests to get data and update page content with new data
- Now a days JSON has replaced XML for the most part and almost all dynamic websites uses/implements AJAX concepts and methodology


1.2. Why use AJAX?
--------------------- 

- AJAX is prety fast - as it allows you to send and receive data asynchronously without reloading the web page
- AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes, this simply means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page
- AJAX is used for building web based interactive applications that process user requests immediately - no page reload to bring data into your application
- AJAX allows us to send and fetch only important/valuable part of data/information to/from the server not the entire page so it makes your application interactive and faster
- XML is commonly used as the format for receiving server data, although any format, including plain text, can be used
- AJAX is a web browser technology independent of web server software/platform
- Data-driven as opposed to Page-driven methodology
